## Abstract

The Regeneration Credit is a (P2P) funding system designed to incentivize the regeneration of ecosystems. Humanity has been destroying nature for centuries, and our survival depends on bringing life back to Earth. The problem is that people currently have more economic incentives to deforest an area and exploit its natural re-
sources than to regenerate it. The project aims to create an additional income for people who are regenerating ecosystems, so they can sell the digital representation of their impact in exchange for new tokens after going through a decentralized certification method.
